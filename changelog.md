**Notes for developers**

- When returning to an already completed section (i.e. changing amounts after selecting a date and time) can make multiple sections active.
- Entering an invalid amount to the already completed amounts section will leave the section completed. If you want to do things like hide completed sections, be aware of this and test thoroughly!
